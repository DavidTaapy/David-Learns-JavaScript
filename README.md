The following repository consists of various small projects that I have completed to learn JavaScript! Each project has it's own directory which includes the written code! Each paragraph below conists of the project description for a project as well as the video link to the video that was followed in the projects!

I have added the sunrise and sunset information above of the video content! The API used in this application is OpenWeatherMap which can be found at https://openweathermap.org/!
